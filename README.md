# Git & GitHub Notes

These are my personal notes made while learning how to use Git and GitHub from scratch.

Includes:

- Git basics (init, add, commit, push, branch, merge, etc.)
- GitHub repo creation and SSH setup
- Common errors and how to fix them

📁 File: `notes.md` contains everything.

🧠 Purpose: To solidify Git/GitHub fundamentals as a part of my dev skillset.
